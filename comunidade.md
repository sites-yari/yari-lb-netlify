We are a group of enthusiasts of functional programming and all related technologies interested in helping others to discover programming languages like Elixir, Erlang, Elm, Clojure, Haskell, F#, PureScript to name a few.

We welcome all levels of ability and expertise.

Our gatherings will alternate between talks and workshops given by either a member of the group or an outside speaker or even a practical programming challenge where you are encouraged to solve the problem in any language, ideally in collaboration with other attendees.
