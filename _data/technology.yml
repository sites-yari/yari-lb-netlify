        title: Elixir
        text: Elixir is relatively new but stands on the shoulders of giants. Fuses the best of Erlang - the runtime, the concurrency model, fault-tolerance and performance predictability, with a powerful extension system, robust metaprogramming and beautiful syntax. Whether you need to start a new project or to integrate with existing infrastructure, Elixir is a proven technological choice to build a scalable system that is easy to maintain.
    stack2:
        title: ELM
        text: Another functional programming language we use on new projects is ELM. The final code is reliable, due to its magnificent compiler. We've yet to see a JS exception in production! The compiler does an excellent job at identifying missed cases, saves you from those errors not usually covered with unit tests. The Codebase is more maintainable. Refactoring is such a pleasure, when big changes are made, the compiler immediately signals all the places where stuff is broken.
    stack3:
        title: Ruby and JavaScript
        text: Our development team is highly experienced on Ruby, Ruby on Rails and Javascript. Most of our current projects are still written using these technologies but we're shifting towards functional programming languages and technologies.
